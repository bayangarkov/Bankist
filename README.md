# Bankist app
Version: 1.0.0 <br>
Bankist app is another project maded in "follow along" mode in one of the Udemy courses by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Instructions

The app imitates bank operations like : </br>
requesting a loan, <br>
transfering money to another acc, <br>
you can see all your deposits and withdrawls and sort them. <br>

If you want to see it in username enter: 'bg' and password : 1111

All the data there is made up. <br>

For the current version all the data is hard coded. <br>

Later in time I will add proper log in with JWT token or something else. <br>
I will add the data for deposits and withdrawls from database. <br>
